/*
In every class where we have created object there was a constructor.

constructor:
	1. its similar to method
	2. but Its name should be same a class name
	3. but it will not have any return type and its won't return any value to JVM
	4. we can't call/execute constructor based our requirement, it will be called/executed whenever class object/instance is created
	
constructor is used to initialize non static members of the class
	type:
		1. default constructor -- when a class doesn't have any type of constructor dn java compiler write a constructor which known as default constructor
							   -- default constructor doesn't have any parameter and its body will be empty
		2. user defined constructor
							  -- when a programmer write a constructor dn that constructor will know as user defined constructor

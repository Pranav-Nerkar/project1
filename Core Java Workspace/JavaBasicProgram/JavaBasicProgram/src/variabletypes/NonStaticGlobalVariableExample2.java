/*
any variable declared outside the method body but declared in class body known as Global variable
- if its declared without static keyword dn it will known as non-static global/instance variable
- non-static global variables are also known as 'instance variable'
	- these variable will be loaded in the memory at the time of execution/runtime when an instance/object is created
			- Instance/object: has an Identify, behavior & state
							- its used to store non-static members(variables & methods)
		    - Syntax to create an instance or object:
		    				classname refvariable; // instance/object declaration
		    				refvariable =  new classname(); // instance/object creation/initilization
		    						//or
		    				classname refvariable = new classname();
	- Once the instance/object of the class is created a copy of non-staic member will be loaded into the memory
	- for non-static member we can have multiple memory allocation based on instance/object creation
	
	- in order access non-static global variable we can use-
		- we can access non-static global variable from another non-static method directly
		- standard -we can access non-static global variable using refvariable name as:
				refvariable.nonstaticglobalvariablename
- if we declare any global variable but not initialized and trying used it dn it will give you default value based on data type
